<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	My name is Sharon. I am a Web Developer because I enjoy creating and wanted
	to combine developing websites with improving the user experience. I am a
	graduate of CareerFoundry's intensive career-changers UI Program with a
	specialization in animation, which led me to learning C# with Unity and
	eventually deciding to combine that knowledge with my prior courses of HTML,
	CSS, Javascript, Python, and more. I am now attending Udemy's Complete 2024
	Web Development Bootcamp to connect the pieces!
</p>
<p>
	I am looking for a role where I can create websites to increase the user
	satisfaction. Most recently, I have been a certified Tech 1 in Comcast's XOC
	department. Peers love to work with me because I bring solutions and ideas
	to the table, act with integrity, and get the job done. I listen to others
	and consider all points and sides of the story. I can also bring a sense of
	humor and playfulness, because all work and no play does not make a great
	place to work.
</p>
<p>
	I am open to work in both remote and hybrid roles, and live in the greater
	Seattle, WA area. I continue to refine my technique and increase my skillset
	every day, and am taking additional courses for Web Development to
	continuously add fresh content to my portfolio and expand my knowledge and
	experience.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of pursuing a career-change, I love to read books and explore the
	wilderness. I am a mother of two children, whom I take camping every year
	and search for new adventures with. If there's anything else you'd like to
	know or would like to connect,
	<a href="./contact.html">send me a message</a>! I am an open book and I love
	to get to know people.
